# React Testing Application

This application is a small React JS application primarily developed for the purpose of testing. It leverages the power of Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, and React's @testing-library/user-event library to facilitate comprehensive testing.

## Testing Components

In this application, we focus on testing two key components:

### UserForm.js

This component is responsible for user input and interaction. We thoroughly test it using various Jest functions and techniques, including but not limited to:

- `getByRole`: To access and interact with elements by their role.
- `jest.fn()`: To create mock functions and track their usage.
- `toHaveBeenCalled`: To ensure that specific functions have been called.
- `toHaveBeenCalledWith`: To check if functions were called with the expected arguments.

### UserList

The UserList component displays a list of users. We conduct comprehensive testing on this component as well, applying similar Jest testing methods.

## Conclusion

This React application serves as a practical example of how to employ Jest and @testing-library/user-event for testing React components. By thoroughly testing UserForm.js and UserList, we ensure the reliability and functionality of these essential parts of the application. This approach helps maintain code quality and provides confidence in the application's behavior.
